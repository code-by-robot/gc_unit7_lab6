              I spent a semester playing women's rugby in college. My old/legal
              name was three syllables and I wanted something shorter that could
              be yelled. I thought Rob was cool. <i>Cue gender feelings.</i>
              <br /><br />
              Originally, I said Rob was short for Robert, but I was so used to
              being the only one with my name in places that having to best
              every single Rob, Bob, Bobby and Robby in hand-to-hand combat was
              daunting. (That's what you have to do when you have the same name
              as someone. I don't make the rules.) <br /><br />
              I also felt disconnected from Robert as a name and chose the
              non-binary noun name of Robot because 1) R.O.B. from Nintendo was
              cool and 2) Robot is a really cool name.

              Not much, really. <br /><br />
              From childhood to my sophomore year of college, I was focused on
              classical music, mainly on viola and mainly in orchestral
              settings. Chamber music was ok, but people actually showed up to
              the big ensemble concerts. During my freshman year of college, I
              started taking engineering classes for fun.
              <br /><br />
              I switched majors to nuclear engineering, which is what my
              bachelor's is in. I worked at a nuclear plant for almost five
              years. In 2020, I met my wife online through a transgender-only
              Discord server. She helped me realize 1) I was autistic as hell,
              2) I was being treated really poorly at my job (i.e. being placed
              on unpaid leave for over a month after requesting ADA
              accommodations, only to have my requests denied). I left my job to
              move across the country and live with her. <br /><br />
              Because of the treatment I faced at my old plant, I decided to
              leave the nuclear industry and make a career change to software
              engineering. It helps that my wife's a senior software engineer so
              I can go to her for help and tips. <br /><br />
